- **Compact MMDetection For Tomato Detect in Jetson Nano Board**

## Introduction

image detection & segmentation for tomato using mmdetection library (mmdetection original: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection )



## Installation

- **Miniforge(conda) Must Be Prepared**
- **Conda Environment Prepare**
- ```git clone https://github.com/lleunyoungll/mmdetectionTomato_JetsonNano.git```
- ```cd mmdetectionTomato_JetsonNano ```
- ```conda env create --file mmdet369.yaml```



## Test

- first, prepare model weight in "link" here -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xo-Xk7gN6RBcBHEYGLq_3ZFkQcqPLNSP/view?usp=sharing
- copy above downloaded model weight file and paste into 'savedModel' directory
- then, modify 'saved_model.txt' contents to copied model file name
- ```python testGUIToMakeSegResultMask.py```
- result images will be in 'testresult/' folder



## Custom Dataset

- If you want to train for your own dataset. Make labeling data using below annotation tool(Labelme.exe)
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/16meD3s6r9VsrRfSsUmlaSMnGDiAZ_Sve/view?usp=sharing
- make labeling like this below â†“

  ![labeling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98143576/152295166-4c6797c1-36e3-488a-9ca7-b46204abbce2.gif)
- If you do labeling, you have image files and json files
- Delete all files in 'imgjsonDataset_8timeSmallSize' directory, then Put above your image and json files you made in Labelme.exe into 'imgjsonDataset_8timeSmallSize' directory


## Train

- open a terminal & conda and activate mmdet359 environment
- ```cd mmdetectionTomato_JetsonNano```
- ```./toCOCOdata_8timeSmallSize.sh```
- then 'Train', 'Test', 'Validation' 3 folders will be made in that directory(mmdetectionTomato_JetsonNano)
- ```python tools/train.py customized_config.py```
- then epoch files will be put in 'work_dir' directory
